⭆ How does personal branding differ from self-promotion, and why is this distinction important?

✍ Personal branding and self-promotion represent two distinct strategies in building one's reputation. Personal branding involves shaping one's brand by showcasing personality, values, education, experience, and skills, gradually forming a favorable perception among others over time.

✍ On the contrary, self-promotion focuses on actively advertising one's abilities or achievements, specifically targeting the promotion of individual skills or accomplishments for a defined purpose or opportunity.

✍ This distinction is crucial because personal branding establishes a foundation based on one's brand, while self-promotion often highlights specific skills or capabilities for immediate visibility. Personal branding shapes one's identity and credibility, setting individuals apart, creating a lasting and consistent image over time.
